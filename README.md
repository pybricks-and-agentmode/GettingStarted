# Lego Spike Prime with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and Pybricks

## Overview

In this project, we will use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to help us write Python code for the LEGO Spike Prime hub using Pybricks.

Pybricks is Python and Block coding for smart LEGOÂ® hubs. Run programs directly on the hub, and get full control of your motors and sensors.

We will turn the traditional LEGO Spike Lessons into an exciting coding experience using GitHub Copilot to help us write the code with Agent Mode.

## Requirements
- LEGO Spike Prime Set
 - Build the "Break Dance" robot as per the [official lesson](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-life-hacks/break-dance//)
- Newest version of Python
- Install pybricks firmware on your hub
- Visual Studio Code newest version
- GitHub Copilot Business Subscription

## Activities

| Activity | Description | Purpose | Repository |
|----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1. Prompt Files | Add features incrementally to the Break Dancer project using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode | Learn about Prompt files and how they enhance code generation | [activity1-promptfiles](https://github.com/pybricks-and-agentmode/activity1-promptfiles) |
| 2. Chat Modes | Plan with Copilot and then build with Agent Mode | Start by planning the work with a Custom Chat Mode and then implement with Agent Mode | [activity2-chatmodes](https://github.com/pybricks-and-agentmode/activity2-chatmodes) |
| 3. Custom Instructions | Explore custom instructions and how they can help you write code faster | Learn about custom instructions and their impact on coding efficiency | [activity3-custominstructions](https://github.com/pybricks-and-agentmode/activity3-custominstructions) |
| 4. FreeStyle | Build your own project with Copilot, or add additional sensors and buttons | Have fun and be creative with your own LEGO Spike Prime project, get started with the template. Examples: Bring in external context - Fetching documentation with Copilot by pasting URLs and implement features with Agent Mode or get Copilot to figure out how the Robot is wired and write code to control it - Learn about Copilots "Self healing" capabilities. | [template](https://github.com/pybricks-and-agentmode/template) |
